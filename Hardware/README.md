# BivalveBit hardware
 Heart rate and valve gape sensor wearable for oysters and mussels. 
 
 * Based around a ATmega4808 microcontroller
 * Designed to fit inside a nominal 3/4" schedule 40 PVC plumbing pipe (<18.5mm
 inside diameter) along with an 18650 size Lithium-Ion battery cell. 
 * Provides one I2C 4-pin port for communicating with a IR heart rate sensor
 * Provides one analog 4-pin port for communicating with an analog sensor such
 as the A1395 Hall effect sensor (with SLEEP pin on the 4th wire). 
 * Writes data to a standard microSD card
 
 Hardware design files were originally created in KiCad 5.1.
